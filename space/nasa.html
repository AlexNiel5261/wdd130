                <p id="p-1">For obvious reasons NASA is the most well known launch provider in the United States, and possibly the world. Rther than a private company, this is a government agency formed in 1958 in response to Soviet Union's launch of the Sputnik satellite. It has since launched 312 rockets and completed several notable milestones. Althought it has developed and flown several rockets, a few stand out more than any other rocket that NASA has flown. The Saturn V, the famous rocket than landed humans on the moon for the first and only time in history. July of 1969 is when the famous "Apollo 11" mission took place, putting Saturn V in the rocket hall of fame forever. The Space Shuttle is both famous and infamous for its long service and reusable orbiter, along with its unforgettable disasters during the end of its service. The SLS, launched for the first time in November 2022, now holds the title of most powerful rocket launched in human history, more powerful even then the Satrun V.</p>
                <p id="p-2">The artemis program has been reaching its adolescent stages with the launch of Artemis 1; the maiden alucnh of SLS, which is the primary vehicle of the program. Artemis can be thought of as the "new apollo", as its primary mission is to return humans to the moon. This time however, we plan to stay there. After likeley over a decade, there will be a "lunar gateway", or space station in orbit around the moon, with astronauts permenantly living around the moon, eventually making regular visits to the surface using a Human Landing System: SpaceX's starship. Artemis 1 was the first test flight of SLS and the Orion capsule, and Artemis 2, scheduled for 2024, will be the first crewed test flight. Finally, Artemis 3, will land humans on the moon once more for the first time in over half a century, taking another step closer to permenant human presence on the moon.</p>
                <p id="p-3">NASA has made several obvious achievements in their long run of spaceflight. The most obvious is the Apollo program. Being the first agency to ever land humans on the moon, and still are the only to have ever done so. They have also broken their own record of most powerful rocket ever launched with SLS beating out Saturn V. They also began the development of reusable vehicles with the Space Shuttle. The shuttle orbiter was reused dozens of times, between 6 different orbiters, and served as the primary gateway to the international space stationt. NASA is also one of the most major collaberators on the international space station, creating permenant residence in space. Through the viking program, they became the first to land any man made satellite on Mars, along with several other landings and exploration to mars through the years. These are just a few of the hundreds of major contributions and revolutions NASA has made in teh space industry.</p>

                <p>Perhaps one of the most famous rockets in history, Saturn V is the legendary vehicle to bring humans to the moon. Previously acredited as the most powerful rocket in history until SLS beat it in Nov of 2022. Fully liquid fueld powered, it used 5 Rockcetdyne F-1 engines: the most powerful single belled engines ever flown. These are RP-1 LOX closed gas generator engines that produce nearly 7 MN of thrust each at sea level. The second and third stage were powered respectively by 5 and 1 Rocketdyne J-2 engines; these being HydroLOX gas generator engines. Saturn V remains the tallest rocket ever flown. Evolved from the initial Saturn I, blocks 1 and 2 used for testing, the Saturn IB was used for skylab missions, until finally the largest yet Saturn V was born and used for the Apollo missions.</p>

                <p>Space Shuttle is an incredibly popular and somewhat infamous rocket and unique in many ways. It's most noteable feature is its use of the reusable orbiter, of which there were 6. The first stage firing at lift off were 3 RS-25 engines: the same engines the SLS now uses. These are HydroLOX fuel rich dual-shaft staged combustion engines. The first stage was also paired with 2 large solid rocket boosters on either side of the main tank. The shuttle's Orbital Maneuvering System consisted of 2 hypergolic liquid fuel engines that more accurately modified shuttle's orbit. 2 infamous and fatal failures occured involving space shuttle killing a total of 14 astronauts; first the explosion of shuttle Challenger on ascent in 1986, and next with the desintegration of Columbia on reentry due to damage to the heat protective tiles. The space shuttle was later retired in 2011.</p>

                <p>Space Launch System is the most powerful rocket to have ever flown, with ~15% more thrust at sea level than the legendary Saturn V. This is the vehicle that will return humans to the moon through the artemis program, and when paired with the HLS. SLS uses at its core stage, 4 RS-25 engines; the very same that flew on the space shuttles. Paired on the side of its core booster is two of the largest solid rocket boosters ever flown. The upper stage, known as the Iterim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage is powered by a single RL10 engine: an expander cycle HydroLOX engine. As of its 1 and only launch during misison Artemis 1, SLS carried the Orion Capsule for testing and later flight of a crew to orbit around moon, and ultimately landing via the HLS.</p>
