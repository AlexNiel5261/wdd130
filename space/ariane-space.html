                <p id="p-1">Founded in 1980, Ariane Space is a french launch provider, and the first commercial launch service provider in the world. It is overseen by several European countries and ESA. Ariane Space has developed several launchers, most well known for the Ariane family of rockets, from Ariane 1 to the newly developed Ariane 6. They also created the light launchers in the Vega family. Ariane Space was created by ESA to oversee operations of the Ariane rocekt, which began testing in 1979, and the recently announced Ariane Next. By 2004, Ariane Space held more than 50% of the world's market for launches to GTO. Their fleet is capable of covering a wide variety of payloads from light to heavy class launches with Ariane 5.</p>
                <p id="p-2">Ariane Space, being one of the most prominant commercial space launch providers, has been trusted with many clients payloads. The most famous of which is likely the popular James Webb Space Telescope developed by NASA. The JWST was launched aboard an Ariane 5 vehicle in late 2021. It was launched to the Sun-Earth Lagrange-2 point, and has since amazed the world with its photos. Ariane Space also has been selected to launch several of Amazon's Kuiper project: this is a internet constellation satellite system.</p>
                <p id="p-3">Ariane 5 is a powerful and well used rocket, that holds severl records. In 2021 it set the record for most mass ever launched to GTO in a single launch, coming in at 11.2 t. The Ariane family of vehicles have launched over 250 times, making it one of the most launched rocket familie to date, behind Soyuz. In 2017 it launched the only all-electric satellite to orbit. Ariane 5 is also Ariane Space's most successful rocket, with over 80 consecutive successess; a company wide record.</p>

                <p>The Ariane 4 was a medium lift vehicle that flew over 100 times. It had variants that determined the number of side boosters it had; anywhere from 0 to 4. Ariane 4 was unique however, in that it could have additional liquid fuel boosters or SRBs, or a combination of the two. This all depended on launch performance needs. They had PAL (liquid) and PAP (solid) boosters, and denoted their variants accordingly. Each PAL produced an additional 752 kN and a PAP produced 650. The first stage is powered by 4 Viking 5C engines, which are hypergolic. The PAL boosters were also hypergolic: they used Viking 6 engines. The second stage was a single Viking 4B. Finally their third stage was a cryogenic HyrdoLOX gas-generator engine known as HM7B. The rocket first flew in 1988 as the AR-44LP. Its final flight ocurred in 2003 as the AR-44L.</p>

                <p>The Ariane 5, currently by far the most famous vehicle from Ariane Space, is a medium to heavy lift vehicle that has also launched over 100 times, and is still scheduled for a few more. This is the rocket that carried JWST to the L-2 point, as well as countless other satellites. It has several variants that followed its evolution process, however one has flown far more than any other, and is the only one still active: the ECA variant. Each of its 2 SRBs produce 7080 kN of thrust. Its core stage, powered by a Vulcain 2, produced 960 kN. The Vulcain 2, an evolution of the Vulcain 1 that flew on previous Ariane 5 evolutions, is a gas-generator HydroLOX engine. The upper stage of the ECA variant uses the HM7B engine, they same HydroLOX engine flown on the Ariane 4 Cryogenic third stage. Ariane 5 first flew in 1996 as the G variant, and the rocket is planned to retire in 2023.</p>

                <p>Vega is the light launched created and managed by Ariane Space. The rocket has primarily been used to carry light payloads to Sun Synchronous Orbit, which has been 17 of its 21 launchess. Its most recent launch in 2022 was performed by its evolution: Vega C, capable of higher performance. The first stage of Vega known as P80 is a Solid Rocket stage. The second stage is also a SR stage which produces 871 kN of thrust and burns for 72 seconds. The third stage is the final Solid Rocket stage with 260 kN of thrust for 117 seconds. The upper and final stage is powered by an RD-843: A hypergolic engine that produces up to 2.4 kN of thrust in a vacuum.</p>
