                <h3>About SpaceX</h3>
                <h3>Starlink</h3>
                <h3>Achievements</h3>
                <p>Founded by Elon Musk in 2002 has quickly become one of the most revolutionary space launch providers. One of the several new private launch providers that has emerged in the 21st century, they have completed several milestones in the space industry. SpaceX developed the Falcon family of launch vehicles, ranging from the small prototype Falcon 1 to the heavy lift vehicle Falcon Heavy. To accompany this family of rocket is their own merlin class engine. With 4 primary variants along with a vaccum version, the merlin helps bring falcon its staple reusibility. For a little under a decade they have been developing at their own Starbase TX the most powerful rocket ever designed: Starship Super Heavy. SpaceX has had a long goal of establishing permenant human presence on mars, and Starship is aimed at that very goal. Its booster stage dubbed "Super Heavy" is powered by 33 of SpaceX's "Raptor" engines. Both Falcon and soon Starship have been the workhorse behind SpaceX's "Starlink" program; A constellation satellite system that aims to give high speed internet across the globe, even in remote areas such as the middle of the pacific.</p>
                <p>Starlink is an ongoing project by SpaceX dedicated to global high speed internet. It is a constellation satellite system that will be able to provide internet without the need of cell towers. It began launching in 2019 as Starlink v1, and as of late 2022, 3000 v1 satellites are currently in LEO. All of these satellites have been brought to orbit over the course of 65 Falcon 9 launches. 12,000 satellites have been planned to be placed into orbit, however v1 production has been slowing, in preparation of larger and more advanced Starlink v2. These satellites are yet to be launched as they require the larger Starship vehicle to be carried into orbit.</p>
                <p>SpaceX has made several achievements in the industry of space flight; The most notable of which is their Falcon 9 rocket. This is the first and only orbital class reusable rocket booster. They completed the incredible propulsive landing in order to reuse the main boosters of the falcon rocket. They are also the first private space company to bring astronauts to the International Space Station, which was done in Nov 2020 aboard Crew Dragon "Resilience" on a Falcon 9. For that matter, it is the first private company to take humans to orbit at all. It is also the first provider to bring an all civilian crew to the ISS. Falcon 9 also flies an unprecedented number of times consecutively; It set a record for most flights in one calendar year in oct of 2022 with 48 launches. It is also well on track to surpass an average rate of 1 launch per week. It is a reliable rocket as well, holding the record for the longest streak of orbital launches without a mission failure or partial failure for a single rocket type. Additionally, the raptor engine devloped for Starship is the only Full Flow Staged Combustion engine ever flown; making it one of the most complex engines flown in human spaceflight history.</p>

                <p>Falcon 9 is SpaceX's primary workhorse and has been a revolutionary vehicle in the space industry. It's a reliable and high capacity vehicle that has been bringing all range of cargo into orbit for years; from government and military satellites to civilians. It evolved from the Falcon 1, a prototype form that used merlin 1A and 1Cs. Later improvements of Falcon 9 continued until the current and most used Falcon 9 Block 5. The Falcon 9 uses Merlin 1D engines, an RP-1 LOX Gas generator power cycle engines. They were designed to be reused with minimal refurbishment. So far a single Falcon 9 booster: B1058 has flown 14 times with a planned 15th over the course of 2 years.</p>

                <p>Falcon Heavy is a heavy lift vehivle variation of the Falcon 9. Using 2 side boosters and a core Falcon booster, for a total of 27 Merlin 1D engines in the first stage. It has launched 4 times, with a 3 year break between the last two launches. It is now however scheduled to begin launching more from Cape Canaveral. If all 3 1st stage boosters are expended Falcon Heavy can be considered a Super Heavy lift vehicle as it surpasses 50 t payload to LEO. Falcon Heavy has the 2nd highest payload capacity of all operational rockets, behind only NASA's Space Launch System. It is also the 4 highest capacity in space launch history behind the Saturn V, Energia, and SLS.</p>

                <p>Starship Superheavy is the most powerful rocket design that has been created in spaceflight history. It has been developed by SpaceX over the last decade, and is nearing its first orbital test flight. Starship is planned to be the launch vehicle of starlink V2, and has a contract to be the Human Lander System onto the moon for NASA's Artemis program. It has a sea level thrust twice that of SLS, the most powerful rocket ever flown previously. It is currently in develpment at Starbase TX, and has recently performed its first full-stack test of both stages. This made it the tallest rocket ever stacked. Powered by 33 raptor 2 engines in the first stage, and 3 sea level + 3 vaccum raptors gives it unprecedented thrust. The raptor is a MethaLOX engine and the first Full Flow Staged Combustion engine ever flown.</p>
