                <p id="p-1">ULA is a joint venture spaceflight company formed in 2006 by the merge of Lockheed Martin and Boeing. ULA is one of the most prominant launch providers in the U.S. With 155 launches since its formation. ULA has several prominant vehicles, most of which are older than the company itself. The delta II was developed by McDonnal Douglas in 1989, and was adopted by ULA at its formation. Atlas V was designed by Lockheed Martin and also became a ULA managed rocket when the company was formed. Delta IV is perhaps ULA's most famous rocket, was designed by Boeing's defense, and became a ULA rocket during the merge. The Delta IV has two main variants: The Medium configuration, and the Heavy configuration. Currently in development by ULA is the Vulcan Centaur vehicle: This is an expendable heavy lift vehicle planned to launch as early as 2023. ULA is also the primary designer of the ICPS used by NASA's SLS. Essentially a modified version of the Delta IV's upper stage.</p>
                <p id="p-2">Its true that many of ULA's rockets predate the company itself, something that can be confusing to many. Keep in mind most of these vehicles were created in some part by either Lockheed Martin or Boeing, the two companies that form ULA. The merge occured in december of 2006, and both companies resources were pooled into one company. They have since begun developing their own vehicles such as the Vulcan. Note that any statistics for the company as a whole are since the formation in 2006, however the statistics of each individual rocket reflect the vehicles since their conception before the merge.</p>
                <p id="p-3">ULA is a prominant player in the space flight industry, and its reputation is on par even witht the government funded agencies such as NASA and ESA. It has launched 155 rockets only since its creation in 2006, a higher rate than NASA and Ariane Space. Even more impressive is the claim that they can make of 0 total failure missions since the formation of ULA.</p>

                <p>The delta II was a strong workhorse of ULA alongside conractors such as NASA throughout the late 20th century and early 21st. It has several variants, the primary 3 being the 6000 series, the 7000 series, and the 7000 heavy. It also varied in the number of Solid Rocket Motors ranging from 3 to 9 motors on a single launch depending on launch needs. Its maiden launch was as a 6000 series in 1989, and it flew its last mission as a 7000 series in 2018. The first stage was a RS-27 main engine which burned RP-1 LOX, and was gas-generator cycle. The first stage also had a series of boosters depending on performance needs. The second stage was a single AJ-10 hypergolic engine. Finally an optional third stage was an SRB Payload Assist Module known as Star 48B. The delta II carried many important payloads, including the Mars Exploration Rovers.</p>

                <p>The Atlas V is another well used rocket by ULA and by its previous owner Lockheed Martin, with a total of 97 launches. It is also the select launcher for Boeing's Starliner crew capsule currently under development. It can have anywhere from 0 to 5 additional SRB for additional performance, each booster would add about 1670 kN of additional thrust. The core stage is powered by a single RD-180 liquid fuel engine. This is an RP-1 LOX dual combustion chamber and nozzle OX rich staged combistion engine. The second stage used either 1 or 2 RL10 engines. These are expnder cycle HydroLOX engines. This is known as the centaur upper stage and is the same that will be used on the new Vulcan vehicle.</p>

                <p>The Delta IV is powerful rocket with several variants; The Delta IV medium had a single Common Booster Core without SRBs. The medium+ had 2 or 4 SRBs. Finally the famous Heavy variant used 2 additional CBCs on the side. The Delta IV was initially developed by Boeing Defense before the formation of ULA. It first launched in 2002 as a M+ (4,2) configuration. The 4 being fairing diameter and 2 being the number of boosters. It has 2 remaining scheduled flights, and the vehicle is planned to retire in 2024. Each CBC is powered by a single RS-68 engine; this being a HydroLOX gas-generator cycle engine. The second stage, known as the Delta Cryogenic Second Stage utilizes an RL-10, the same engine used in SLS's ICPS. This is a HydroLOX expander cycle engine used in several upper stages.</p>

                <p>Vulcan is a medium to heavy lift vehicle being developed by ULA. Similarly to their previous rockets, it has variants based on the number of SRBs attathced to the core stage. Added in pairs it ranges from 0 to 6 SRBs. The 4 and 6 booster variants are classified as heavy lift vehicles. The core stage is propelled by 2 of Blue Origin's designed BE-4 engines. These are MethaLOX LOX rich staged combustion engines. Its second stage is the Centaur V stage, which is powered with 2 RL-10s, similar to the DCSS. A proposed "Vulcan Heavy" using a total of 3 core stages has also been proposed and may be in development.</p>
