                <h3>About Rocket Lab</h3>
                <h3>Photon</h3>
                <h3>Achievements</h3>
                <p>Formed in June 2006 by Peter Beck, Rocket Lab has been a notable small time public launch provider that is known for its reliability and affordability. With its Electron rocket it specializes in small satellite launches for cheap prices. Rocket Lab has a single operational orbital rocket: the Electron. Powered by Rocket Lab's own Rutherford engines, electron is a cheap small satellite launcher that has been gaining popularity. While it was designed to be expendable, they have recovered the first stage twice in its 31 flights. Rocket Lab is currently developing Neutron, a larger fully reusable vehicle. Rocket Lab has their own satellite tug spacecraft known as Photon that they use to deliver satellites to their needed orbits.</p>
                <p>Photon is Rocket Lab's personal satellite tug that they use in deep space missions. Photon can bring payloads to GTO, TLI, and possible even planetary courses. Photon began development in 2019 and performed its maiden flight in June of 2022. Still in early stages of use, they aim to be able to launch interplanetary missions with Photon by the end of 2023.</p>
                <p>Rocket Lab is still a small yet not unoticeable launch provider. They are the cheapest option by far in the small satellite market, being able to deliver 150kg to a 500m sun synchronous orbit for less than $5M per launch. Their rutherford engines are also unique in their use of electric motors instead of gas generator or preburners, greatly simplifying the engine in certain ways. In 2012 they made an interesting demonstration of a Viscous Liquid Monopropellant; a fuel that behaves like solid fuel until shear force is applied. This yielded several benefits, but never seemed to be developed further.</p>

                <p>Electron is Rocket Lab's only orbital class rocket, and has been flying since May 2017. Its maiden flight was a failure but has had a strong history of successes since. It is the worlds only reusable* small satellite launcher, and has deployed 151 sattelites into various orbits. It's rutherford engines are uniquely electric-motor powered, and use RP-1/LOX propellants. Also somewhat unique to Rocket Lab, they 3-D print a majority of the parts for their engines and rockets. They are capable of manufacturing all composite parts for the electron rocket in a mere 12 hours with their new process.</p>

                <p>Neutron is a medium-lift launch vehicle being developed by Rocket Lab for the primary purpose of mega-constellation satellite launches. It is a reusable configuration planned to potentially bring satellites to Mars. Its engine configuration is still somewhat unknown but it is known that the first stage will contain 9 MethaLOX oxygen rich staged combustion engines. It is planned to fly as early as 2024.</p>
