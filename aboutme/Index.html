        <p>
            I am from Winston-Salem North Carolina; home of Krispee Kreme and Texas Pete Hot Sauce. I grew up and lived there all my life, 
            and as of this fall have begun my first semester as a freshman here at BYUI. I am a Computer Science major, and have wanted to
            learn how to program computers my whole life. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Programming is quite literally a hobby of mine and I enjoy it very much; Other hobbies of mine include scuba diving, fishing, and D&D. 
            I am loving it here at BYUI; I've always loved the west, as I have plenty of family in the area, and I will take the mountains over the 
            beach any day. I also enjoy the cold and am looking forward to the infamous idaho winter. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I have been a member of the church my whole life; Growing up in the gospel has been very beneficial and because of it I've always dreamed
            of coming to a BYU school, and now here I am!
